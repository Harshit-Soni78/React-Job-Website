# React Job Website

This project is a job listing website built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend. It's a full-stack MERN application that allows users to browse, add, edit, and delete job listings.

It was originally inspired by a YouTube tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0) but has been extended with a custom backend.
